# Safe Chat Application

Safe Chat is a mobile chat application designed to provide a safer online environment by reducing instances of cyberbullying. It leverages a machine learning backend to filter out toxic messages, making online communication more secure and respectful.

## Features

- **Toxicity Filtering:** Uses a large language model-based filter to detect and reduce cyberbullying in real-time.
- **Machine Learning Backend:** The chat application is powered by an LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model trained on binary classification tasks.
- **Data Augmentation:** Applied techniques to rebalance the training dataset from an imbalanced ratio of 1:4 to a more optimal ratio of 2:3, improving the model's performance.
- **Mobile Application & API:** The application is complemented by a robust API that facilitates seamless integration with other platforms.

## Achievements

- **92% Accuracy:** The LSTM-based RNN model achieved an accuracy of 92% in detecting toxic messages.
- **Research Publication:** Published a research paper titled “Text-Based Cyberbullying Prevention using Toxicity Filtering Mobile Chat Application and API” at the 2022 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Information System (ICDSIS).
